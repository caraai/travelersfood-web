		My name is Hugo and I have traveled almost all my life. I was born in Mexico City, and started my traveler life since I was a few months old. My parents encouraged me to travel over the world, with their company, or my wife’s, or colleagues’, or just myself. I am a software engineer, my greatest hobby is traveling and enjoy the food that offer those trips.

	<p>
		I have considered myself as a gourmand and nor a gourment, because for me it is a delight as the 3 Michelin stars as the street food. Most of my contributions are from Mexico City, where I currently live, but are not limited. I was fortunate to try street food in almost all the continents, so, you will find contributions of these places.
